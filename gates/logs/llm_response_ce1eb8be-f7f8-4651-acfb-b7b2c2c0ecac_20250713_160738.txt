## HARD GATES TO ANALYZE WITH COMPREHENSIVE REGEX PATTERNS

### STRUCTURED_LOGS

*   Patterns:
    *   `^.*\{.*\}$` (JSON object)
    *   `^\[.*\]$` (array or list)
    *   `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d{3}Z` (ISO 8601 timestamp)
    *   `[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+=\d+|\[.*\]|\{.*\}` (log message with key-value pairs or arrays/objects)
*   Description: Ensure logs are structured and searchable for operational monitoring by using standardized formats like JSON, ISO 8601 timestamps, and log message...

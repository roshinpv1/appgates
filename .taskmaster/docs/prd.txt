# CodeGates - Cross-Language Hard Gate Validation & Scoring System
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project Overview
CodeGates is a comprehensive, cross-language hard gate validation and scoring system designed to ensure production-ready code quality, security, and reliability. It validates code against 15 production-critical "hard gates" across multiple programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#/.NET) and provides detailed reporting with LLM-enhanced analysis.

### Current Architecture
- **Core Engine**: Python-based scanning and validation engine
- **Multi-Language Support**: Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#/.NET
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI and local LLM support for enhanced analysis
- **Reporting**: HTML and JSON report generation
- **API Server**: FastAPI-based web API for programmatic access
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for scanning and reporting
- **JIRA Integration**: Automated posting of scan reports to JIRA issues

### Current Issues & Pain Points

#### 1. JIRA Integration Authentication
- **Problem**: Enterprise JIRA authentication failing with 403 "Failed to parse Connect Session Auth Token" errors
- **Impact**: Cannot post scan reports to enterprise JIRA instances
- **Current State**: Basic authentication works for cloud JIRA, but enterprise/server JIRA fails

#### 2. Configuration Management
- **Problem**: Environment variables not consistently loaded across different components
- **Impact**: JIRA integration shows as available but not enabled
- **Current State**: Multiple configuration loading mechanisms not properly synchronized

#### 3. SSL Certificate Verification
- **Problem**: Enterprise environments often have custom SSL certificates
- **Impact**: HTTPS requests fail in corporate environments
- **Current State**: SSL verification disabled as workaround

#### 4. Report Attachment System
- **Problem**: HTML reports need to be attached to JIRA issues for comprehensive analysis
- **Impact**: Limited visibility of detailed scan results in JIRA
- **Current State**: Basic attachment functionality implemented but needs testing
